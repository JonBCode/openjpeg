#summary OpenJPEG Coding Style

= C =

OpenJPEG is meant to be portable. OpenJPEG is using ANSI C.

There is one exception to this rule: large file support, since it requires C99. The build system is checking for LFS in the C compiler. In this case you need a C99 compiler to have LFS support in OpenJPEG

For doxygen, one should use /** and */
