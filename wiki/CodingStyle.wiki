{{{
  Q: Does OpenJPEG requires C99 compiler ?
  A: No
}}}
{{{
  Q: Are you sure OpenJPEG does not requires C99 compiler, because I see stdint.h in the source code
  A: Yes !
}}}
== Description ==
OpenJPEG is meant to be portable. OpenJPEG should only requires ANSI C (C89) compilers.

== Exceptions ==

Instead of re-inventing the wheel, OpenJPEG will use C99 notations in two occasions:
 * fixed-type notation
 * large file support

OpenJPEG uses two build-system: cmake & autotools. Both support system inspection and compiler detection. What happen in that:
 * iff compiler provide a stdint.h we will use it
 * iff compiler provide large file support we will use it

So in summary:
 * if your compiler does not provide a stdint.h we will emulate it using compiler private extension
 * if your compiler does not support Large File Support, you will not have support for LFS in OpenJPEG

Note: since we use type from stdint.h we will use the C99 notation PRIi64, PRIu64 & PRIx64 for printing the fixed 64 bits type. Again this is not a requirement on your compiler, we will use your compiler private extension as replacement if PRI?64 is not present.

== Portability ==

File should be pushed to server with UNIX eol

== Comment ==

Because OpenJPEG is written in C. One should use C style comment: {{{/*}}} and {{{*/}}}

For doxygen, one should use {{{/**}}} and {{{*/}}}

= Open Questions =

 * What charset to use for unicode ? UTF-8 is a good contestant. Eg: "Universit√†" in comment
 * tab spaces ? indent ? uncrutify rule ?
 * file type (UNIX eol would be nice)
