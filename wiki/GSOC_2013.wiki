= Introduction =

[https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013 Google Summer of Code 2013] has been announced and mentoring organizations are able to apply until March 29th.

This year, OpenJPEG will apply as organization.

Quick overview of OpenJPEG is [https://code.google.com/p/openjpeg here].

If you have any questions, feel free to contact the OpenJPEG mentoring administrator, Antonin Descampe, at (antonin -at- gmail com).

If you are volunteering to become a mentor, please read the topics below and contact the administrator.

If you are a student interested in any of the following projects, please go to [GSoC2013Student GSOC 2013 Student Application page] to apply.

This page contains a few project ideas (which, by no means, limits any prospective proposals).

== Improve the OpenJPEG API ==

Proposed by: Mickaël Savinaud

There is a need for a OpenJPEG API reworking after the 2.0 release. Indeed the API is too complicated and it is not adapted to communication with other softwares. For example it could be nice to provide a a modern C API based on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_pointer opaque pointer] to facilitate the future evolution. A good example could be find into the [http://www.gdal.org/gdal_8h.html C GDAL API]. The use of opaque pointer for image properties, metadata (color, additional information) will need to provide several accessors (get/set) or to use a key-value system. Another evolution is to avoid the allocation of (encoding or decoding) data by OpenJPEG. With this API evolution, user will pass through the API a char buffer previously allocated with the correct size. It will simplify the management of data and improve the performance (in the encoding part some data copy are done but can be avoid with this new framework). 

The project would consist of three parts:
  * evaluate and study the some API based on opaque pointer (GDAL is a good project)
  * implement the opaque pointer for the image structure 
  * implement the system and functions to access to this sructure
  * implement the new data management into this new OpenJPEG API

= Possible ideas =

  * Continue GSOC2012 project : GPU implementation
  * Enable multithread encoding and decoding
  * Improve speed performance of entropy coding part
  * Firefox plugin implementation

== Mickaël Savinaud ==
== Nicolas Bertrand ==

Nicolas is a PhD student working on Digital Cinema, with Utopia ( a French network of indie cinema theaters). The goal is to provide a full open-source solution for creation, projection and distribution of digital copies in theaters. As Digital Cinema uses JPEG2000 for compression, OpenJpeg was chosen for encoding and decoding Images. More precisely, Nicolas work on OpenJpeg decoding optimization, to speed-up the decompression time to reach a decoding frame rate from 1/24 to 1/30 s on a "standard" machine ( no dedicated hardware used).
