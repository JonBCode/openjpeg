#summary Wiki page for the prep of v1.5 release

= Introduction =

Let's list the things remainings to do before v1.5.

v1.5 is frozen, this means no NEW feature should go in, only bug fixes.

= Summary of tests failing =

For the moment we have worked on the decoding part and the encoding part must be considered as unstable so all test with prefix ENC should ignored for the moment in the trunk. broken, broken2, broken3 and broken4 should failed.

If you used dashboard filter, you can see that it remains 38 tests linked to the fact when we decode some C0 (Cclass0) conformance files we produce multiband files but we must not because reference pgx file have only one. 36 tests are linked to this point. I am not sure to understand what we can do to avoid this point, perhaps Antonin have more ideas on it.
For the trunk, we have a strong problem with p0_07.j2k file described in issue 80 http://code.google.com/p/openjpeg/issues/detail?id=80 which is not correctly decoded.

For the branch 1.5 which will be the next release, the list of tests with problems not linked to C0P0 or C0P1 files are listed here http://my.cdash.org/viewTest.php?onlyfailed&buildid=264729&filtercount=3&showfilters=1&filtercombine=and&field1=testname/string&compare1=64&value1=C0P0&field2=testname/string&compare2=64&value2=C0P1&field3=testname/string&compare3=64&value3=broken <http://my.cdash.org/viewTest.php?onlyfailed&buildid=264729&filtercount=3&showfilters=1&filtercombine=and&field1=testname/string&compare1=64&value1=C0P0&field2=testname/string&compare2=64&value2=C0P1&field3=testname/string&compare3=64&value3=broken>
