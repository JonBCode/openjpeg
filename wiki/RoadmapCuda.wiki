#summary Roadmap for integrating CUDA code

= Introduction =

GSoC 2012 did produce some nice optimized CUDA code for OpenJPEG:
https://gitorious.org/~aditya12agd5/openjpeg-optimization/aditya12agd5s-openjpeg-optimization

This page will describe the steps to integrate this branch into svn/trunk

= Participants =

 * Mathieu Malaterre
 * ?

= Details =

 # Create cuda subdirectory in src/lib/openjp2
 # Move all cuda-related code within this directory
 # add new compile time CUDA option (cmake)
 # rename cuda wrapper function to have `opj_` prefix (just in case)
 # start compiling as compile time option
 # add new runtime option to select in between CPU based alg and GPU based
 # Ship OpenJPEG 2.2 !

We should try to minimize any API break !
