#summary Guideline for Version Control System in OpenJPEG

= Introduction =

OpenJPEG is maintained using SVN

== SVN ==

=== svn commit message ===

Commit message should contains the branch it is commited to. Eg, on branch openjpeg-1.5 the commit message should read:

[1.5] fix invalid write access in j2k_foo


== GIT-SVN ==

Because DVCS are easier to work with when it comes to merging/branching. Some people might enjoy the benefits of GIT over the OpenJPEG SVN:

=== cloning ===

{{{
$ git svn clone https://openjpeg.googlecode.com/svn/ -T trunk -b branches -t tags
$ git svn show-ignore >> .git/info/exclude
}}}
